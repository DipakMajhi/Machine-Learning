Project: Titanic Survival Exploration


In 1912, the ship RMS Titanic struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank, resulting in the deaths of most of its passengers and crew.

In this project, we will explore the RMS Titanic passenger data to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive.

Here are the highlights to note:

1) On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.

2) One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.

3) Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class
