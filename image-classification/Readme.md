##Image Classification

In this project, we'll classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. We'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. We'll get to apply what you learned and build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. At the end, we'll get to see your neural network's predictions on the sample images.
